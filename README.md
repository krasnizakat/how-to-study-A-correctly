## 🧠 Before Studying

- First, find a purpose. Why are you studying? In my case, I just love being on the computer. Not only that, but I'm very interested in hacking.
- Ask yourself: why are you doing all this? I'm not destroying your dream, but if you don’t love what you’re doing, it’s impossible to study.
- Make your path. What will you do after A+? Maybe you just want to stop at A+, and that's okay — but here’s my path:  
  👉 Get A+ → Get Security+ → Grind for OSCP → Build big projects → Make a GitHub portfolio → Build a real LinkedIn profile → Start working for foreign companies.

## 📖 How I Study (Offline)

- **Book:** “The Official CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2 Study Guide (Exams 220-1101 & 220-1102)”
- Start with **Lesson 1** (boring USBs and cables). Don’t just read. First, look at the questions at the end of the chapter.
- Now **go find the answers in the book**. When you find the answer, don’t just memorize it — **understand why**.
- ✍️ **Write down the explanation** in your notebook. That’s how you learn deeply.
- If you try to read the whole lesson and then answer questions, you’ll forget. Read questions first, hunt the answers second.

## 🌐 Studying from the Internet (My Way)

Some people can’t learn from books only. Here’s my strategy:

### ✅ Professor Messer
- Go to YouTube and search **Professor Messer**.  
  Recommended playlist: [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/87t6P5ZHTP0?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01u)
- Watch the videos while taking notes.
- He covers every topic for free.

### ✅ ChatGPT (My Favorite)
- I ask ChatGPT:
  > “Hey! I’m studying for CompTIA A+, give me tips and questions to test my knowledge. I’m currently on Lesson X.”

- GPT gives tips (some corny ones, lol) but the **questions are 🔥**.
- When I get something wrong, I write it in my notebook, then find the real answer in the book.
  Example:
  - Q: *How many storage devices can be attached to a single SATA port?*  
  - I answered: **2** ❌  
  - I write this down as a **mistake**, then go learn the real answer and understand it.
